Beoros

An operating system kernel written in a bit of assembly and Go language. 
It's a hobby project for now, to prove that it's possible to do it. 

It consists of a few subprojects: 

runtime : The Go language runtime written in Go language (not C) and some assembly.
kernel  : The Beoros operating system kernel.
